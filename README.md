# php-integrator-autocomplete-plus

This package provides autocompletion for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base) as well as Atom's [autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

What is included?
  * Autocompletion for local variable names.
  * Autocompletion for global functions and constants.
  * Autocompletion (snippets) for tag names in docblocks.
  * Autocompletion for class, interface and trait members.
  * Autocompletion for class, interface and trait names as well as their constructors.
  * Automatic adding of use statements when class names are autocompleted (with a somewhat intelligent positioning).
    * Included is a command to sort the current use statements.

## Regarding donations
Donations were not my primary intention when releasing this project as open source, but I do accept them and am very grateful for any donation you may give. As such, a link to the (PayPal) donation screen is located [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YKTNLZCRHMRTJ), at the bottom of the readme, hidden from initial sight and not even in the form of a fancy button ;-).
