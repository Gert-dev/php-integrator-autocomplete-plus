## 0.2.0
* Autocompletion of class names inside comments will now no longer work.
* Class autocompletion will now work when the cursor is at the start of a line.
* Variable names and members will now be completed inside double quoted strings `[1]`.
* The type of variables is now displayed, if possilbe, when autocompleting variable names.
* Where possible, autocompletion is now performed asynchronously using promises instead of blocking for a process, improving performance.
* The right label of the items in the autocompletion window will now display the originating structure (i.e. class, interface or trait) when autocompleting members.
* Restrictions for function and constant autocompletion is now more relaxed, i.e. after "if (!" you will now receive autocompletion for built-in PHP functions and constants.

`[1]` This might also complete in a few rare erroneous cases as well (e.g. `{SomeClass::test}` instead of `{${SomeClass::test}}`), but it's better to have autocompletion for common used cases and in a few rare erroneous cases than no autocompletion at all.

## 0.1.0
* Initial release.
